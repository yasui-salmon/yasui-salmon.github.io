I'm a research scientist in Cyberagent, Inc.

My research interest is in the intersection of Machine Learning and Economics(not only Causal Inference!).
I am interested in the sampling/selection bias in the real-world application. Also, I am interested in how we can combine Mechanism Design, Causal Inference, and Machine Learning.

Research Topics
======
- Counterfactual Machine Learning
  - Off-Policy Evaluation/Learning
- Causal Inference and Machine Learning
  - ITE Prediction
  - Uplift Modeling
- Computational Advertising
  - Delayed Feedback
  - Advertising Auction
