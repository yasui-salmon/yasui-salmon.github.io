I'm Principal Data Scientist/Senior Researcher at [CyberAgent, Inc](https://www.cyberagent.co.jp/).

My research interest is the intersection of Machine Learning and Economics.
Especially, I am interested in the sampling/selection bias in the real-world application and Distributional Treatment Effect. Also, I am interested in how we can combine Causal Inference, and Machine Learning.

Research Topics
======
- Counterfactual Machine Learning
  - Off-Policy Evaluation/Learning
- Machine Learning for Causal Inference
  - ITE Prediction
  - Uplift Modeling
- Causal Inference
  - Distributional Treatment Effect
- Computational Advertising
  - Delayed Feedback
  - Advertising Auction
